# FCC-Tribute-Page

First of Five Projects to succeed in Responsive Web Design Certification

This project is a fork of FCC's sample webpage: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx .

**But that is only to get the idea about design, I've fully worked on html & CSS code this site. 

I have tried best and hope that all _user stories_ tests get passed.
