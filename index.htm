        <p id="bio">
          Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941), often recognised as India’s ‘Frida
          Kahlo’, is one of the nation’s most celebrated female modern artists.
          Heavily influenced by Realism, Sher-Gil strived to portray the lives
          of people living within her local community. She was one of the most
          gifted artists of the pre-colonial era.

            "Modern art has led me to the comprehension and appreciation of
            Indian painting and sculpture. It seems paradoxical but I know for
            certain that had we not come away to Europe, I should perhaps never
            have realised that a fresco from Ajanta or a small piece of
            sculpture in the Musee Guimet is worth more than a whole
            Renaissance."
